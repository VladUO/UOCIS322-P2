Description: the program currently returns the contents of a file to the client. If the requested file is not found in the DOCROOT directory, the program returns a “File not found!” message. If the requested address has one of the forbidden combinations of characters contained within it (//, ~ or ..), the program returns a “File is forbidden!” message.
